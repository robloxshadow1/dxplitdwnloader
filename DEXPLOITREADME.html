    <p>Hello user!</p>
    <p>We noticed you are downloading our exploit program</p>
    <p>Here is some information you should know:</p>
    <p>If you run a scan on dexploit, it shouldn't say it's a virus.</p>
    <p>If it says it's a virus, that's because of the "tools" inside.</p>
    <p>Please support us on Discord if something doesn't work, and we'll try to fix it ASAP.</p>
    <p>Sincerely, Dexploit team</p>
